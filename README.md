Hi, this is my side project!

The goal is to experience with things and potentially host it in the future when I am done (no database/storage because $$$)

Currently thinking of using Socket.io to make a simple chat app.
Once comfortable, make a chess bot engine + implement online anonymous chess matches between 2 players.

### Client 
```
cd client && npm i && npm run dev
```

### Server
```
cd server && npm i && npm run dev
```

Then go to `http://localhost:8080/` for the web app.
